MIL-STD-1553 Introduction

# Introduction 
U.S. Department of Defense military standard MIL-STD-1553
NATO standard STANG 3838
First published by US Air Force iin 1973
Differential serial data bus operating at 1 mb per second.

three types of nodes
 1. Bus Controller ----------- 

-Only One in 1553
-initiate all message traffic on the bus
- it can command RT to transmit and receive data.



 2. Remote Terminal

- provides interface between 1553 bus and subsystem.
-it can also be used to bridge to another 1553.
- each one has unique address
- there can be up to 31 remote terminals.
 3. Bus Monitor

- it is typically used as a message recorder or black box type function

Bit rate 1.0 mb per second 
half duplex 
Twisted shielded cable (called as Twinax) terminated on each end.
  


__________________________

Two methods for connecting a  node to the bus 

1. Direct Coupling - stub length up to 1 foot
2. Tranformer Coupling - Stub length up to 20 feet

the tranformer coupling method is preffered method. why because is it has improved signal integrity and fault tolerance. 



1553 Message Types
* Receive Data
* Transmit Data
* Broadcast Data
* Mode Code
* RT to RT transfer ---- # RT is Remote Terminal 


Receive Data Message 
----------------------
- sent by the bus controller to remote terminal 
- Bus controller can sent from 1 to 32 data word.
- the selected remote terminal responds with a status word

Transmit Data
-------------

- sent by the Bus controller 
- sends 16 bits command word.
- selected remote terminal reaponds with the 16- bit status word follwed by 1 to 32 data words.

Broadcast Data.

- sent by the bus controller


Mode Code
----------

- bus controller sends command word followed by zero to one data words.
- and the selected remote terminal sends a status word followed by one or zero data words.

RT to RT Transfer
------------------
