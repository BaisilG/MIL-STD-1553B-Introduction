NATO standard STANG 3838
First published by US Air Force iin 1973
Differential serial data bus operating at 1 mb per second.

three types of nodes

-Only One in 1553
-initiate all message traffic on the bus
- it can command RT to transmit and receive data.



 2. Remote Terminal

- provides interface between 1553 bus and subsystem.

Two methods for connecting a  node to the bus 

1. Direct Coupling - stub length up to 1 foot
2. Tranformer Coupling - Stub length up to 20 feet

the tranformer coupling method is preffered method. why because is it has improved signal integrity and fault tolerance.
